# CPCS-SVM
This project aims to train a Support Vector Machine model to classify whether a customer will churn or not in a telecommunications company. The dataset consists of customer information including the target variable "churn" (0 for not churned, 1 for churned). The remaining attributes include customer demographics, service usage, billing information, and other relevant features. This task aims to build an SVM classifier to classify the customers.
